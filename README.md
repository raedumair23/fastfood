# 🍔 FastFood - React Native Mobile App

**FastFood** is a responsive and scalable mobile application developed using **React Native**. It provides a modern and efficient food ordering experience, allowing users to browse fast food items like burgers, pizzas, and more. Items are fetched from an external API using **Axios**, and users can add them to a cart managed by **Redux**.

## 🧾 Project Overview

FastFood follows a clean and modular code structure with clear separation of concerns—making the app easy to scale and maintain. Axios handles dynamic data fetching from a backend API, while Redux ensures reliable and centralized state management, particularly for the cart system.

All styles are built using **Styled Components** for a consistent, reusable UI across screens. The app is designed to be fully responsive, offering a smooth user experience on various mobile screen sizes.
